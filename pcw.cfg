//	Practice war configuration CS:GO file 
//	File was created on October 2013. I used it for pickups/pcw (teams/mix).
//	Last updated : September 2015 (English corrections).
///////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////
//	Server configuration file used on a CKRAS Server (https://www.ckras.com/ ).
//	CKRAS as provider for three reasons : 1) Popular and insane quality 2) Located in Germany: Sweden & others may have a reasonable IG ping 3) Based SSH attack IG protection 4) DDOS protection.
//	This configuration use the official ESL server file (http://www.esl.eu/eu/csgo/download/26251762/ ) as a model, modification by Sub^ (wipe off rates/log parameters and outdated commands, disallow buying zeus, show damages in console, warmup settings).
//	I left the logs and net-codes (rates...) configurations on the provider side.
//	This file is error free (tested & debugged).


//	Check clients files.
